# Crypto Info App

## Overview
This application fetches and displays cryptocurrency information. The frontend is built with React, and the backend is built with Node.js and Express. I used Nodemon for automatically restarting the server during development.

## Prerequisites

- MongoDB

## Setup

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the frontend server.

### Backend

2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx nodemon` to start the backend server using Nodemon.

## Testing
- Navigate to the respective frontend or backend directory.
- Run `npm test` to run tests.

## Technology Stack
